Interesting Engineering Ideas come to mind from time to time. But are they feasible? Let's find out


## Can or Not?

This phrase is often used in Singapore and Malaysia to express the 
doubt as to whether an idea or an approach of solving something is
feasible.

We like to ask "Can or not?"

It is our way of doing Singlish.

At times, I will have science and engineering 
ideas in my mind that interest and intrigue me. For example, 

1. how to reduce waste and/or closed loop recycling
2  how to grow more food with limited land or resources.
3. how to generate energy sustainably
4. how to generate water with limited resources available
5. how to reduce Greenhouse Gas Emissions
6. how to save energy in existing processes
7. how to integrate engineering with environmental consciousness 
and art to make things aesthetic


Therefore, I've decided to make a repository and videos about that.

## The Process

There are a few questions i will ask:

1. Has someone done it before?
2. What stage of development is it in?

I may or may not delve into economics. But that largely depends on how much
time i have.

## The Verdicts

If an idea is, in my opinion, feasible, I will say:

"Can one!"

Which is Singlish for, "yes it can be done".

If an idea is, in my opinion, not feasible, I will say:

"Sure boh?"

Which is Singlish for, "are you really sure? I'm doubtful as to
whether the idea is credible"

If, in an unlikely scenario, I'm really unsure as to how the idea would
pan out, I can say

"Dunno lah. See how"

Which is Singlish for "I'm not really sure, we'll keep this matter in view
and decide the actions to take later on."
