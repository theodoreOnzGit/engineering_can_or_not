# Use of Plastic Waste in Smelting and Roads

## The Problem: Plastic Waste

Plastic waste is accumulating in excess. Even plastic meant to be
recycled is just offloaded to [Malaysia](

and the [Philippines](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDFBbxMDi1U).



What then can we do?

## When evaluating solutions...
1. Has someone done it before?
2. What stage of development is it in?


## Solution 1: Use in Roads

[Thunderfoot says no!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj_FZduqblo). This
is for 100\% plastic roads which do not comprise of crushed rocks.

However, using plastic as an additive to asphalt or bitumen may prove 
practical. [Macrebur](https://macrebur.com/us)

## Solution 2: Use in Smelting Ores

It seems to be an established idea. [
    India
](https://www.financialexpress.com/lifestyle/science/use-of-plastic-waste-in-iron-and-steel-industry-can-convert-waste-to-wealth-steel-minister/2507550/)
has considered using it.

It has also been used in Japan, Germany and Austria on an industrial scale
56,000 tonnes of plastic in Japan 1996. See paper below:

# The Verdict

## Sure boh?
1. 100\% use of waste plastics for road building

## Can one!
2. use of waste plastic as an additive for bitumen or asphalt
3. use of waste plastic including polyvinyl chloride (PVC) for reducing 
metal oxides
