# Use of Plastic Waste in Smelting and Roads

## The Problem: Plastic Waste

Plastic waste is accumulating in excess. Even plastic meant to be
recycled is just offloaded to [Malaysia](
    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdZBgDgdm5E)
and the [Philippines](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDFBbxMDi1U).



What then can we do?

We cannot really burn plastics as there is a concern of releasing
dioxins such as [2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzodioxin](
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzodioxin)
into the atmopshere. Usually temperatures are not hot enough to decompose
the plastics.

Therefore, we need to do something else to reduce the plastic waste 
stockpiles. Here we evaluate two ideas, namely use of plastics in 
building roads and the use of plastics in blast furnaces.


## When evaluating solutions...

We have to ask some questions such as:


1. Has someone done it before?
2. What stage of development is it in?


## Solution 1: Use in Roads

The idea of using 100\% plastic for road construction presents practical
challenges. As such, it has not been used in a large scale.
[Thunderfoot says no!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj_FZduqblo). 
When I mean 100\% plastic roads, I mean roads
which do not comprise of crushed rocks. 

However,
roads tend to be mostly crushed rock with bitumen as a binder. The bitumen
used is mostly a hydrogen poor hydrocarbon with some aromatic organic compounds
functional groups (a fancy way of saying rings of carbon). 
Plastic is also a hydrocarbon which can potentially serve as a binder as well.
Therefore, using plastic as an additive to asphalt or bitumen may prove 
practical. [Macrebur](https://macrebur.com/us) 
[uses this approach](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBG0yWEfcPg).
In fact,
using plastic as a [feedstock](
    https://resource-recycling.com/plastics/2020/08/19/how-a-company-is-turning-pet-into-durable-asphalt/
) for making 
bitumen seems to have been done before too.

It seems that this idea is quite feasible! Can one!

## Solution 2: Use in Smelting Ores

An interesting idea to help reduce plastic waste stockpiles the the
use of plastic in smelting ore.

Iron ore needs a reducing agent in the form of coke or carbon monoxide
in order to be converted into liquid iron.

$$Fe_2 O_3 + 3C -> 2 Fe + 3 CO$$

$$Fe_2 O_3 + 3CO -> 2 Fe + 3 CO_2$$

However, the reducing agent can just as well be plastic. Plastic can
be converted into a mixture of CO and $H_2$ at high temperatures
found in a blast furnace (about 1000 &deg;C). This is known as gasification.

$$Fe_2 O_3 + 3 H_2 -> 2 Fe + 3 H_2 O$$
$$Fe_2 O_3 + 3CO -> 2 Fe + 3 CO_2$$

At these temperatures, dioxins are destroyed and prevented from forming.
Additionally, having this much reducing gas ($CO$ an $H_2$) in the environment
also prevents dioxins from forming.

What about the halogens though? (Chlorine, Bromine, Fluorine)

For Chlorine, the $HCl$ gas that forms can be scrubbed using limestone
$Ca(OH)_2$.

$$Ca(OH)_2 + 2 H Cl -> 2H_2 O + Ca Cl_2$$

Calcium chloride is relatively harmless compared to the dioxins and hydrochloric
acid. For bromides and fluorides, I haven't bothered to research, but I reckon it
can be dealt with too.

Practically speaking, it seems to be an established idea. [
    India
](https://www.financialexpress.com/lifestyle/science/use-of-plastic-waste-in-iron-and-steel-industry-can-convert-waste-to-wealth-steel-minister/2507550/)
has considered using it.

It has also been used in Japan, Germany and Austria on an industrial scale
56,000 tonnes of plastic in Japan 1996. See paper below:

[Paper by Devasahayam et al.](
    https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589299119300618)

Devasahayam, S., Raju, G. B., & Hussain, C. M. (2019). Utilization and recycling of end of life plastics for sustainable and clean industrial processes including the iron and steel industry. Materials Science for Energy Technologies, 2(3), 634-646.

Based on this paper, it seems that this is not a new idea. It can be used
in a large scale and if there are no practical concerns, I think it is a great
idea to reduce plastic waste.

# The Verdict

My opinions:

## Sure boh?
1. 100\% use of waste plastics for road building

## Can one!
2. use of waste plastic as an additive for bitumen or asphalt
3. use of waste plastic including polyvinyl chloride (PVC) for reducing 
metal oxides
